<p>Some optimization problems in wireless networks can be a natural application of non-cooperative games. By analyzing the convergence
for non-cooperative game based algorithms 
in tiered networks, we can gain insight into when we can adopt non-cooperative mechanisms for sharing communication nodes and when we should use orthogonal
resources. </p>

<p>Another important application of algorithmic game theory is mechanism design in areas like spectrum trading, where the spectrum acts as
a commodity that can be sold to customers (in our case, customers can be user equipments, base-stations, or both). More generally, power or backhaul bandwidth can
 also be viewed as a valuable resource for trading.</p>
