<p>
We study the spectrum sharing in heterogeneous networks considering the queue-stability of the victim layer.
Traditional resource scheduling baed on channel condition alone may lead to intolerable user backlogs and frequent
package drops. Based on Lyapunov optimization, we designed algorithms to control the interfering tier power 
adaptively constrained on the queue-stability on the interfered users.
