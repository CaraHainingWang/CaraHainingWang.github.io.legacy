title: Improving Spectral Efficiency for ad hoc Networks
Keywords: MIMO, ad hoc networks, link adaptation, joint transceiver design, successive interference cancellation.
---

<p>The projects aim at improving the spectral efficiency of ad hoc networks using multiple MIMO techniques. 
By striking a balance among several trade-offs for different techniques, such as power control, beamforming/precoding, interference cancellation, 
link adaptation, spectrum division, etc. simulations have shown more than 50 times gain in terms of spectral efficiency
compared with the baseline. </p>
