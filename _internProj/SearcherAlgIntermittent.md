title: Searcher Algorithm Enhancement with Intermittent Scheduling
Keywords: C++, AGC, WCDMA.
---

<p>AGC(Automatic Gain Controller) output may suffer from intermittent up-shooting or down-shooting due to its transient response
during intermittent HSPA scheduling in WCDMA systems.
Algorithm is designed and simulated in C++ to adaptively compensate the spikes. Performance shows that the proposed scheme can
significantly improve searcher performance in terms of false alarm rate while not decreasing the detection rate.
